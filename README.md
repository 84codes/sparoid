# single-packet-authorization

fwknop type of SPA service, implemented in crystal.

The server listens on UDP, when it receives a message it tries to verify it (HMAC), decrypt it (AES-256-CBC), then verify the nounce (that it haven't been seen before, reply attack), that the timestamp is within 10s, and that the IP in the message matches the source IP.

If all checks passes the firewall is opened for the IP in the message. After 15s the port is closed again.
